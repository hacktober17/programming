		Use very basic understanding for condition of a prime number.
		Let's call it noobPrime()
	
		We will try to create three to four functions with different complexity.

		If you don't have any idea about creating functions :

			Visit (Have a quick read) :
				https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-functions 
				http://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-functions-examples/

			Normally a function looks like this :

				return_type function_name (argument list)
					{
					    Set of statements â€“ Block of code
					}

	//creating a flag variable
	int flag = 1, iterator;

	if(num <= 2){

		//ofcourse it is prime, coz 1 is prime and 2 is prime (but what about zero -> homework)

		flag = 1;

	for(iterator = 2; iterator < num; iterator++){

		if(num%iterator == 0){
			flag = 0;
