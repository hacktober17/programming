This is a simple app that, based on user input, creates an array of random numbers.
It then requests a second number from the user from a specific range (arraySize * 4).
It will search the array for that number and return a notification of 
success or failure.
It then asks the user if they wish to see the array of random numbers and
outputs the array if the user enters "Y" or "y".
