Zfactor
=======

Calculates the compressibility/gas deviation factor (Z) for a simple gas (composed entirely of up to three compounds: methane, ethane and propane), according to Standing & Kantz correlations. 

### Z factor

In simple terms, the Z factor is a term that can be used to generalize the ideal gas equation of state(EoS).

The ideal gas EoS is PV=nRT, where:
- P : pressure
- V : volume
- n : number of moles
- R : the molar/gas constant
- T : temperature

This can be generalized by adding Z, thus the above equation becomes:

PV=nZRT

and this allows the equation describe real gasses, and potentially fluids in general.
