What is Kaprekar-number?

In mathematics, a non-negative integer is called a "Kaprekar number" for a given base if the representation of its square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number, with the proviso that the part formed from the low-order digits of the square must be non-zero although it is allowed to include leading zeroes.

Examples: 

45 is a Kaprekar number, because 452 = 2025 and 20 + 25 = 45. 

1 is Kaprekar in every base, because 12 = 01  in any base, and  0 + 1 = 1
