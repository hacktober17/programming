# Project Euler code solutions

Problem sources: [www.projecteuler.net]()

### About
This repo is designed to contain solutions for Project Euler's problem set. It should be noted that 
I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE those who come to this repo to atempt the problems first. If you get stuck, take
a moment away from the problem and come back.

### Use
The code in this repo should be used to check work, provide alternative solutions, refactor for more
optimized solutions, and provide help for those who cannot understand the problems they encounter. Do
not copy/paste these solutions in order to increase your Project Euler score without putting the work
in. **THAT IS WRONG!**

### Future
Updates and future work on these solutions (past Hacktoberfest) will be available by [github.com/matmcal](@matmcal) as he 
finds time (and the motivation).
