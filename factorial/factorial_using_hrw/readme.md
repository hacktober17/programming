# Factorial Half Reverse Way

This is my way to calculate factorial, first you divide the number you want it's factorial
then you multiply every number until it's half counting up with every number until it's half counting down

For example: 10!
```
1*5
2*4
3*3
4*2
5*1
```

Then you multiply all of the multiplication results together and then multiply the result by 2, and there you have it, a fast fun way to calculate factorial.
